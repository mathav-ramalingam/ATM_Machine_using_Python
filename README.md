In this project, I created a console-based ATM interface using Python, enabling users to perform various banking operations seamlessly. Here's a quick rundown of the functionalities:

1. Authentication: Users must enter their user ID and PIN to access the ATM functionalities securely.

2. View Balance: Users can check their account balance with just a click.

3. Withdraw: Users can withdraw money from their accounts hassle-free.

4. Deposit: Conveniently deposit money into your account at any time.

5. Transaction History: Keep track of your transactions with a detailed transaction history feature.

6. Quit: Exit the ATM interface when you're done.
